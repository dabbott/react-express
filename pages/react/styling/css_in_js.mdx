# CSS-in-JS

What if we could combine the inline styles and CSS approaches to get the best of both worlds? There's a third category of libraries that let us use CSS syntax inline in our JavaScript files. We call this approach **CSS-in-JS**.

This seems to be the most popular approach for styling in React, although it comes with its own set of complexities. Let's take a look at the CSS-in-JS library <RepositoryLink user={'styled-components'} repo={'styled-components'} title={'styled-components'} showStars />.

<Example
  code={styledComponents}
  vendorComponents={[
    [
      'styled-components',
      'https://unpkg.com/styled-components@4.4.1/dist/styled-components.min.js',
    ],
  ]}
/>

We can wrap our components using `styled`, which will create a CSS StyleSheet and apply the right `className` behind the scenes. Using this approach, we can write styles using familiar CSS syntax, while still getting the benefits of dynamic styles based on component `props`.

### In summary:

**Pros**

- Dynamic (based on component props)
- CSS features (psuedoclasses, media queries, keyframe animations)
- Vendor prefixing
- Familiar CSS syntax
- Component styles live in the same file as code and behaviors
- Works on every React renderer (web, native, etc)

**Cons**

- Very opinionated coding style (creating a component per style)
- Increases code size (slower to load):<br /><img src={'https://img.badgesize.io/https://unpkg.com/styled-components/dist/styled-components.min.js?compression=gzip&label=gzip%20size'} />
