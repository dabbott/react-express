# Components

React **components** are the reusable building blocks we use to create the user interface of our app. We can think of a React component as a _template_ that takes parameters as input, and outputs a React **element** tree.

There are 2 ways we can define a React component:

- **Function components** - A function that takes parameters (called `props`) as input, and returns a React element
- **Class components** - A `class` that extends `React.Component` and implements a `render` method

We instantiate a component, e.g. `MyComponent`, as an **element** using JSX as `<MyComponent />` or by calling `React.createElement(MyComponent)`.

Lets take a look at each way we can define a React component.

## **Function Components**

The most common kind of component is a function that returns a React element.

<Example code={functionComponent} />

In this example, we instantiate the component `MyComponent` with a single prop, `text`, equal to `"Hello, world!"`.

The function instantiates a `div` component as a React element. The `div` React element contains a single child, a `button` element. The `button` in turn contains a single child, although in this case the child is the string we passed in as the `text` prop.

Then, we call `render` to render this UI hierarchy to the browser DOM.

## **`React.Component`**

We can also create components by subclassing `React.Component`, e.g. `class MyComponent extends React.Component`, and overriding the `render()` method to return a React element. This was the _original_ component API, before function components were added to React.

> This API can become significantly more complex, without providing major benefits, so it's best to use function components if you're not maintaining legacy code.

<Example code={classComponent} />
