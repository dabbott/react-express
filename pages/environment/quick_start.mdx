# Quick Start

Let's set up a new app with the `create-react-app` command-line utility from Facebook.

> If you don't have `npm` installed yet, head over to [this section](/environment/setup_and_tools/npm) and come back when you're done!

## Create an app

To initialize a new app, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

and then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## That's it!

You're all set up with a new React app. If you need it, you can find the full guide for getting started with `create-react-app` [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#getting-started).
