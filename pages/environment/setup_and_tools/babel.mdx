# Babel

Babel is a highly configurable compiler that lets us use newer JavaScript syntax, transforming the newer JavaScript syntax into older syntax that's supported on a wider range of platforms. Babel supports many other kinds of code transformation plugins, e.g. plugins that "polyfill" missing APIs on platforms that don't support them.

Babel enables debugging of the original source code by including **source maps** with the compiled JavaScript. JavaScript interpreters will run the compiled code, but map it to the source code in the debugger so that we can debug the source code instead of the (generally quite ugly) compiled output.

> If you're looking for a simple React setup, you don't need to install Webpack. You should instead use `create-react-app`, described in the [Quick Start](/environment/quick_start) section. Manually installing and configuring Babel gives you more control over your stack, but isn't necessary to get started with React.

## Plugins and presets

Babel comes in two parts: the core, and plugins. Each individual language feature that Babel can transform, such as ES2015 classes, has a separate plugin. Collections of plugins are grouped into **presets**, so that we don't have to install and configure hundreds of individual dependencies.

## Which presets should we use?

We'll almost certainly want the `env` preset, which includes plugins for compiling newer JavaScript syntax into older JavaScript syntax. This plugin is highly configurable, letting us choose which browser versions we want to support.

You'll also need the `react` preset to use the React JSX language extension.

## With Webpack

To use Babel in a project bundled with Webpack, we should use [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader). You can install the necessary dependencies with

```
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader
```

We can then add the `babel-loader` into our `webpack.config.js`.

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'webpack.config.js'} code={webpackConfig} />

We add a `module` section if we don't have one already, specifying a new rule for loading `.js` (and potentially `.jsx`) files. We configure webpack to load all `.js` files with the `babel-loader`, so that files are transformed into browser-safe JavaScript. We exclude files in `node_modules`, since the libraries we install here should already be compiled by the library authors, and because Babel can get slow when watching too many files at once. We specify the `cacheDirectory` option to improve performance by caching compiled files.

## Babel Configuration

We can configure Babel by including a `.babelrc` file in the root directory of our project. Here we can specify which presets and plugins to use.

Given the presets we downloaded above, create a `.babelrc` file and add the following:

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'.babelrc'} code={babelRc} />

Note that we want to use the `env` preset with the `modules` option set to `false`, since Webpack can better optimize our code this way.
