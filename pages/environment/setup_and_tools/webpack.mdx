# Webpack

Webpack concatenates all of our JavaScript code into a single JavaScript file or a handful of files (sometimes called a **bundle**), which makes it easier to include in an HTML page. Webpack is _highly_ configurable with plugins, allowing us to transform and bundle much more than just JavaScript — but we won't be needing this functionality.

Webpack is a huge topic, and the official documentation is a work-in-progress. You'll likely run into issues and have to search for relevant stack overflow answers and git issues. For now, this is pretty normal, so expect to do some troubleshooting and don't get too discouraged!

You can find the Webpack docs [here](https://webpack.js.org/). The [overview](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) of Webpack is very good.

> If you're looking for a simple React setup, you don't need to install Webpack. You should instead use `create-react-app`, described in the [Quick Start](/environment/quick_start) section. Manually installing and configuring `webpack` gives you more control over your stack, but isn't necessary to get started with React.

## How it works

When we provide `webpack` with an entry file (the JavaScript file to run _first_, e.g. `index.js`), `webpack` will analyze the file and determine which other files it depends on via calls to `require` (the `node.js` API to include another file). It then cleverly concatenates all necessary files into a single file.

Webpack lets us use `npm` packages for client-side development by

- crawling the filesystem, reading calls to `require`, and bundling all necessary JavaScript files into a single file that can be served on the web
- polyfilling (faking) the `node` APIs so that code can run in both environments

## Minimal setup

Let's look at a minimal `webpack` setup. We won't add React just yet, since it's important to understand `webpack` basics before adding more complexity.

Feel free to follow along and treat this as a tutorial, or just read through and see how the pieces fit together. If you decide to follow along, make a new directory and run `npm init` inside it to get a blank `package.json`.

### Installation

Assuming we're in a directory with a `package.json` file, we can add `webpack` and the development server to a project with

```
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

Note the use of the `--save-dev` option: this installs `webpack`, the Webpack CLI, and the development server as a **dev dependency**. Any code which is necessary to _build_ your project during development, but not when _running_ in the browser, should be a dev dependency. We don't want to bundle unnecessary code into our app.

### Scripts

We'll add two commands to our `package.json` file in the `scripts` section:

```js
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --env development",
    "build": "webpack --env production"
  },
  ...
}
```

We can run any commands listed in this section by running `npm run` followed be the name of the command, e.g. `npm run start`.

The `start` script will start our development server, passing the string `"development"` to our config file. The `build` script will save a single `.js` file on the filesystem for serving from a production server. We'll use these scripts shortly to bundle and test our app.

### Configuration

Webpack is most commonly configured using a separate config file: `webpack.config.js`. This file must export a configuration object, or a function which returns a configuration object, which the webpack compiler will use when run from the command line as `webpack`. Let's add a `webpack.config.js` now:

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'webpack.config.js'} code={webpackConfig} />

There are only three essential fields: the mode, the entry point file, and the output file. We can use the `env` flag to specify a different configuration for development/production (remember, we pass `"development"` as options in our `start` script). In this case, we're relying on the `mode` being set to `"development"` or `"production"` to configure a variety of webpack settings [automatically](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

> It's also possible to use separate config files for development and production. I personally prefer using a single config file with an `env` flag, since I find that they tend to be more similar than different, but separate config files are more explicit and can avoid developers forgetting mistakenly adding something that shouldn't be used in development/production.

### Essential files

Let's add the bare minimum files needed to see something on the screen. First, we'll create an `index.js`:

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'index.js'} code={indexJs} />

Then we'll make an `index.html` and load our webpack-generated `bundle.js` within it:

<Example panes={['editor']} title={'index.html'} code={indexHtml} />

> Wondering why there's no html tag? It's convenient to omit [optional tags](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Optional_Tags)!

### Running the development server

Now we can run `npm run dev` to run the script we set up in the `package.json`. This will start the development server. If we navigate to `localhost:8080` in a browser, we should see our `index.html` file, which will run our `index.js` bundled into `bundle.js`, displaying `Hello World!` on the screen.

![Hello World](/static/webpack-hello-world.png)

The `bundle.js` file will be served from memory by the development server. For production builds, we'll want to use `npm run build` to build an optimized `bundle.js`, which will be saved to the filesystem.

For reference, our directory should contain the following files:

<Example
  panes={['editor']}
  files={[
    ['index.js', indexJs],
    ['index.html', indexHtml],
    ['webpack.config.js', webpackConfig],
    ['package.json', packageJson],
  ]}
/>

> It's fine if the versions of dependencies in your `package.json` are different.

### That's it!

Those are the steps needed to set up a minimal webpack build. There are lot of other plugins and configuration options worth learning. In the next few sections, we'll add the babel plugin for transpiling our code, and we'll install the React library.
