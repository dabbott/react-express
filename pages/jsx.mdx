JSX is an extension to the JavaScript language that adds a new kind of _expression_, the **JSX expression**, used to create React elements (which we'll cover soon).

JSX expressions are a concise syntax for calling the API, `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)`.

We can use JSX expressions anywhere we could use any other expression, e.g. in a `return` statement or variable assignment.

## Type

Like XML, each JSX expression has a tag, e.g. `<div />`, which is then transformed into a call to `React.createElement("div")`. In this case, `"div"` is the **type** of the element.

<Example panes={['editor', 'transpiler']} code={`const element = <div />`} />

> On the right in the example above, we can see how our JSX expressions are compiled by babel.

## Props

Any JSX _attributes_ become **props** (parameters) of the React element. The value of an attribute can be a string, like `foo="hello"`, or it can be any JavaScript expression when wrapped in curly braces, as in `bar={baz}` (which would set the value of the `bar` prop to `baz`).

<Example
  panes={['editor', 'transpiler']}
  code={`const element = <div foo="hello" bar={baz} />`}
/>

## Children

Any children elements should go between the opening tag, `<div>`, and closing tag `</div>`. Elements without children can using a self-closing tag, like `<div />`, as a shorthand.

<Example panes={['editor', 'transpiler']} code={jsx} />

> When a JSX element wraps to multiple lines, we often write it with parentheses around it, since it looks nicer.

## Interpolation

Children are generally other elements, but can also be plain text or any other kind of expression if wrapped in curly braces, `{ ... }`.

<Example panes={['editor', 'transpiler']} code={jsxChildren} />

## Why JSX?

The XML-like syntax is typically more concise, easier to read, and visually looks a little like the generated UI (both are tree-like). We don't _have to_ use JSX, but there are few disadvantages, so we probably should use it.
