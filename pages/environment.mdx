# Environment

There are two common ways to set up a new React app:

- The CLI utility, `create-react-app`
- A JavaScript bundler, like Webpack

Both options leverage `npm`, the `node.js` package manager. We'll cover `npm` separately, if you're not familiar with it.

If you'd rather skip environment setup for now, feel free to jump ahead to the [React](/react) section. This site uses an embedded browser-based React editor so you don't need a local environment to go through the examples.

## Create React App

Facebook provides a command-line utility called [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) which automatically sets up a new React project with a sensible default project structure and feature set. This is the best way to start a new project as a beginner.

You may outgrow this option as you get a better grasp of React and want to customize your stack. Fortunately, `create-react-app` offers an `eject` command to export your app, so you're not locked in.

We'll walk through this in the next section, [Quick Start](/environment/quick_start).

## JavaScript Bundler

Most React apps are built using a JavaScript bundler. A bundler combines all of your JavaScript source files into a single file, which can then be included in a `<script>` tag in an HTML page.

The most widely-used bundler is [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Webpack is extremely configurable thanks to its extensive plugin ecosystem. If you want more control and flexibility than `create-react-app` offers, consider learning Webpack.

> This is the tool used under-the-hood by `create-react-app`!

## Let's get started!

The following sections will cover the tools you need to build a React app either using `create-react-app` or from scratch using Webpack.
