# useState

The `useState` hook lets us "remember" a value within a component function. Since our component function may be called many times throughout the lifecycle of the component, any variable we declare normally (i.e. with `let myVar = ...`) will get reset. With `useState`, React can remember a **state variable** for us, making sure it gets passed into our component instance correctly.

## API

The `useState` hook takes a single argument, our initial state, and returns an array containing two elements:

- `state` - the current state
- `setState` - a function to update our state

E.g. `const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)`

## Example

In this example, we'll use `useState` to append to an array.

The `useState` hook can store any type of value: a number, a string, an array, an object, etc. We've previously used `useState` to [increment a number value](/react/events) and [change a string](/react/user_input).

<Example code={useStateArray} />

Awesome! We start with an initial state of `[1, 2, 3]`, and when we click "roll dice", we see new values appended to the list.

Note how when we call `setDiceRoll`, we're not pushing the integer returned from `randomDiceRoll()` into the `diceRolls` array. Instead, we return a new array containing the destructured `diceRolls` array and the newly randomized dice roll. Why?

Hooks can tell React to re-run our component function and update the UI. The `useState` hook tells React to re-run our component function whenever we call `setDiceRolls` with a different value. Internally, `useState` then compares the current value of `diceRolls` with the value we passed to `setDiceRolls` using `===`. If we're using a mutable value like an array, and we only change its contents, `useState` won't detect that change and won't tell React to re-run our component function. This will result in our UI displaying old/stale data. To avoid this problem we need to create a new array, so that `useState` will detect that our data changed and display the newest data.
